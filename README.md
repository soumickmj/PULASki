PULASki = **P**robabilistic **U**net with **L**oss **A**ssessed through **S**tatistical d**I**stances

The official code of the paper "PULASki: Learning inter-rater variability using statistical distances to improve probabilistic segmentation"

The preliminary idea was presented at the SIAM Conference on Mathematics of Data Science in September 2022, within the talk titled "Model Geometry Uncertainty Quantification for Improved Hemodynamic Data Assimilation".

Then, the method and the initial results were presented at the ISMRM 2023 in June 2023, titled "Exploiting the inter-rater disagreement to improve probabilistic segmentation" (Program Number: 0810).
